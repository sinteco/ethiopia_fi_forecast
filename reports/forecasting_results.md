# Task 4: Forecasting Results and Interpretation

## 2. Forecast Summary (Base Scenario)

| Indicator | 2024 (Obs) | 2025 (Fc) | 2026 (Fc) | 2027 (Fc) | NFIS-II Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Account Ownership (Access) | 49.0% | 58.0% | 61.6% | 64.6% | 70% (by 2025) |
| Digital Payment Usage | 35.0% | 42.9% | 45.6% | 48.4% | - |

## 2. Scenario Analysis
- **Optimistic Scenario**: Account Ownership could reach **69.8%** by 2027 if Fayda ID and M-Pesa interoperability catalyze faster new-to-bank acquisition (higher net-new factor).
- **Pessimistic Scenario**: Growth might stall at **59.2%** if the "Slowdown Paradox" persists and users continue to open multiple accounts without expanding unique inclusion.

## 3. Key Interpretations
1.  **Access-Target Gap**: Ethiopia is likely to fall short of the NFIS-II target of 70% account ownership by late 2025, reaching it instead around 2028-2029 in the current trajectory.
2.  **Usage Momentum**: Digital Payment Usage shows strong momentum, driven primarily by the lag-build-up of Telebirr and M-Pesa. Usage is expected to grow by ~13.4pp over the next 3 years.
3.  **Drivers of Growth**:
    - **Telebirr**: Remains the primary driver for both indicators.
    - **Fayda ID**: Expected to have the largest "new inclusion" potential starting in 2025/26 by simplifying KYC for rural populations.

## 4. Key Uncertainties
- **Account Overlap**: The extent to which M-Pesa users are unique vs. existing Telebirr/Bank users remains the largest source of forecast uncertainty for Access.
- **FX Reform Impact**: While liberalization is enabling, inflationary pressures could temporarily slow usage growth in 2025.
