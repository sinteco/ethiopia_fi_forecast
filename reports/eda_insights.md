# Task 2: Key EDA Insights

## 1. The 2021-2024 Slowdown Paradox
Despite the launch of Telebirr (2021) and M-Pesa (2023) leading to 65M+ registered accounts, national account ownership (Access) only grew by 3pp (46% to 49%). This suggests that new mobile money accounts are largely being opened by people who *already* have bank accounts, or those who open multiple accounts without becoming unique newly-included individuals.

## 2. Gender Gap Evolution
The account ownership gender gap remains significant at ~18-20pp. While male ownership reached 56% in 2021, female ownership lagged at 36%. Preliminary 2024 data suggests this gap is closing slowly if at all.

## 3. Registered vs. Active Gap
Operator reports show massive user bases (e.g., Telebirr at 54M), but activity rates are often lower. For example, M-Pesa's 90-day activity rate is ~66%. This indicates a need for 'Usage' depth beyond 'Access' enrollment.

## 4. Infrastructure as a Leading Indicator
4G coverage has surged from 37.5% to 70.8% in just two years. This infrastructure expansion is strongly correlated with P2P transaction volume growth (+158% YoY), suggesting infrastructure enables Usage even when Access growth stalls.

## 5. P2P Crossover Milestone
2024/25 marked the first time P2P digital transfers surpassed ATM cash withdrawals in count. This is a clear signal of moving from cash-heavy to digital-ready behavior among active users.

## Data Quality & Limitations
- **Sparsity**: Most usage indicators only have 1-2 data points, limitng deep time-series correlation.
- **Findex Frequency**: The 3-year gap between major surveys leaves 'blind spots' in annual progress tracking.
